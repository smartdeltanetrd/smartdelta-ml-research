# Container to isolate environment for SmartDelta DS work

This container:
* inherits from Ubuntu container and also installs additional python modules from Poetry files
* installs graphic support and forwards X session by the following path: `local host => ssh login to remote server (with X forwarding) => launched container => remote server => local host`
* creates internal user in container to perform read/write operations under it (instead of "root")
* shares user home directory for read/write by internal user within container environment

```
